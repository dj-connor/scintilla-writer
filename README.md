# The Scintilla Writer
## Project description </br>
My aim with this project is to develop my own, simple [writer deck](https://www.writerdeck.org) that incorporates my own keyboard and e-ink screen preferences. This project is largely inspired by the [Freewrite Traveler](https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-traveler), a device I have wanted for a few years, but I could never justify the $500 purchase cost. Along the way, I have pulled inspiration from many different projects including the [Zerowriter](https://github.com/zerowriter/zerowriter1) (you can even [order a Zerowriter](https://www.crowdsupply.com/zerowriter/zerowriter-ink) now), the [Penkesu](https://penkesu.computer), the multiple iterations of the [Micro Journal](https://github.com/unkyulee/micro-journal/tree/main) (which you can [order online](https://www.tindie.com/stores/unkyulee/) if you're quick to respond to his new stock alerts), and the Reddit user communities for the [Zerowriter](http://reddit.com/r/zerowriter/) and for general [writer decks](https://www.reddit.com/r/writerDeck/). </br>

  Before you decide to go down this road, **be warned**: Designing and building a writer deck is a non-trivial task, and the costs (money and time) can add up very quickly. If you just want a writing device, I would **highly recommend** that you buy an existing writing device (several options above!). While this has been a fulfilling project, it has been far more challenging than I had anticipated. Using an e-ink display introduces many challenges that have been not-so-fun to overcome, and, even after many weeks of work, I am just starting to overcome some seemingly simple obstacles (like getting the e-ink page to partial refresh, ugh). </br>
  
  **Another warning**: I am a novice (at best) Python coder, so much of what you see here could be optimized and may not even work for you. </br>

## Design requirements
1. Use an e-ink display
2. No larger than a textbook
3. Keyboard that is nice to type on
4. Battery-powered (with a minimum of 5 hours battery life)
5. Should be something I want to bring with me
6. Single-use device for writing
7. 3D printed enclosure
8. Clamshell design to protect the screen when not in use

## e-Paper  
My code here started as a fork of the sample code from [Waveshare Electronics](https://www.waveshare.com) for their e-Paper displays (the displays themselves are from [Good Display](https://www.good-display.com)). </br>
