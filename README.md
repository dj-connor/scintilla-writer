# Explain
## Project description </br>
My aim with this project is to develop my own, simple [writer deck](https://www.writerdeck.org) that incorporates my own keyboard and e-ink screen preferences. </br>

## e-Paper  
My code here started as a fork of the sample code from Waveshare Electronics for their e-Paper displays (the displays themselves are from Good Display). </br>
